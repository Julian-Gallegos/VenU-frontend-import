# Project Prep 301

## Chris Hollis, Erik Dodd, Julian Gallegos, Cianenry Danan

## Cooperation Plan

Every person on your team is an asset. This is your chance to discover the hidden strengths and areas for growth for each team member.

Describe at least:

### What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Chris Hollis: Project management background with backend knowledge.

Erik Dodd: Results, Communication, Business Acumen, Teamwork. Enjoy CSS. Preference for backend at the moment.

Julian Gallegos: B.S. in Computer Science, generally comfortable with programming, communication. Comfortable anywhere but CSS.

Cianenry Danan: Adaptability, attention to detail. Comfortable more with CSS. 

### How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Chris: Main focus on the backend and then assist in areas necessary.

Erik:
I’m interested in working on the CSS and React. Happy to fill-in as necessary wherever needed. 

Julian:
I’m comfortable working with any concept, so I’ll try to be flexible by assisting anyone who feels like they need help, otherwise I’ll primarily be on React with the others as that’s where I believe the most work will go.

Cianenry:
More experienced with CSS, but comfortable enough to help out with React or the backend when needed. Very average in all areas. 

React: Julian & Erik & Cianenry

Backend: Chris

CSS: Cianenry & Erik

FLEX: Julian

OAuth: Julian

### In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Chris: Gain front end technical skills and terminology.

Erik: Root Cause Resolution and Technical

Julian: Leadership and communication

Cianenry: Communication skills. Both terminology and choosing correct words in general. 

### Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

- Maintain 9AM - 6PM schedule.
- Daily meetings in the morning
- Splitting up roles/division according to strengths and making sure we do Code Reviews for FE/BE/0Auth/etc to make sure everyone understands every part of the project

## Conflict Plan

Your team should agree on a process for handling disagreements, should they arise. It is better to have a plan in place ahead of time so you can all refer back to it when necessary.

Describe at least:

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

- Democracy (vote if needed) and a coin flip as a back-up.
- Communicate early, frequently
- If conflict arises, we can resolve sooner without to having to escalate to a teacher
- Bring up concerns in daily meetings or sooner and we can respond. This can apply to workload, unexpected delays, or interpersonal challenges.

### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

- Communicate concerns in daily meeting or sooner

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

- Viewing this as a learning opportunity where we can teach/share with each other to improve overall understanding of concepts, ideas, etc.
- Stick with the plan of division of labor and adjust as needed

### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

- Communicate concerns in daily meeting or sooner

### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

- As soon as the conflict arises
- Escalate to Adam for mediation if need be

## Communication Plan

Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

- Slack for after hours communication
- Remo Daily
- Communicate/work primarily during 9-6PM hours. If needed we can work outside of that but no expectation of that being required.
- Ambiguity/questions/concerns get addressed ASAP and in the morning if need be.

### What hours will you be available to communicate?

- 9-6PM is the primary time to work/communicate.
- Slack for after hours
- If needed set-up additional time to work together or meet
 
### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

- Slack for after hours communication
- Remo for working hours

### How often will you take breaks?

- Whenever needed
- Communicate outside commitments/appointments/etc ahead of time

### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

- Communicate during daily meeting
- Figure out the steps on how to catch up
- Use FLEX team members to pivot to tasks or different areas (React/CSS/Backend/etc) that require immediate attention

### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

-Communicate with slack.  

### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

- Addressing concerns during morning meetings 
- Asking for thoughts and opinions in general

### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Voice concerns if anyone is displaying problematic behavior
Involve instructor when needed
Create a positive work environment by using words of encouragement

## Work Plan

Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

Chris: Main focus on the backend and then assist in areas necessary.

Erik:
I’m interested in working on the CSS and React. Happy to fill-in as necessary wherever needed. 

Julian:
I’m comfortable working with any concept, so I’ll try to be flexible by assisting anyone who feels like they need help, otherwise I’ll primarily be on React with the others as that’s where I believe the most work will go.

Cianenry:
More experienced with CSS, but comfortable enough to help out with React or the backend when needed. Very average in all areas. 

### How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

Use project manager tools

### What project management tool will be used?

GitHub Projects

## Presentation Deck

https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1r3tLwTBc6nTGQZG2yMSP8G7XglB4OYhirF9hC0BqZu8/edit#slide=id.g2accd1c413_3_31

Schedule your practice session
Work with your instructor to pre-schedule an date and time for your “practice run” of your presentation. This should either be an exact time, or a short window of time designated by your instructor. Plan for a 30-45 minute meeting during the class session before your actual presentation to allow time for both your practice run and feedback from the instructional team.

Reminder as you work on and practice your presentations:

Expressions of gratitude should be heartfelt.
When not presenting, team members should make strong eye contact with the “audience” / camera.
Be positive, no matter how tired or burned out you may feel … “Your smiles can be heard over the phone”
Git Process
Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

## Git Process

Plan out what your team’s Git workflow looks like for coding tasks.

Describe at least:

### What components of your project will live on GitHub?

Front end: React
Back end: Server

### How will you share the repository with your teammates?

GitHub with every team member as collaborators.

### What is your Git flow?

Every change or new feature that we make should be developed in a different branch, upon feature completion, submit a PR and have other team members check that the functionality is working as intended.

### Will you be using a PR review workflow? If so, consider:

  * How many people must review a PR?
Two should be good enough

  * Who merges PRs?
2 people, whoever gets to them first.

  * How often will you merge?
When a core feature is finished. A feature with functionality like a state change or an specific route request handler, or a group of CSS work completed, unless is finished.

  * How will you communicate that it’s time to merge?
Will typically use remo or slack. Communicate what core feature was finished (the PR should also have a description of implemented features and changes).

OUT - What will your product not do.
These should be features that you will make very clear from the beginning that you will not do during development. These should be limited and very few. Pick your battles wisely. This should only be 1 or 2 things. Example: My website will never turn into an IOS or Android app.
For the scope of this course, the project will not be supported by IOS or Android
This app will not let users listen to music.
Minimum Viable Product vs
What will your MVP functionality be?
Find venues in a specified location with a static map from locationiq, and save your favorite artists and venues to track when these artists are playing at your saved venues. Search for specific artists to see all venues that they will be playing at.
What are your stretch goals?
More interactive, dynamic map with clickable venue locations that open up modals with information specific to that venue.
Allow users to see ticket information and purchase them using external sites like stubhub
Stretch
- Added map functionality
- Suggestive venues and artists dependent on saved venues and artists.
- Text message alerts for saved artist upcoming shows at saved venues.

Functional Requirements
List the functionality of your product. This will consist of tasks such as the following:
An admin can create and delete user accounts
A user can update their profile information
A user can search all of the products in the inventory

Users can create an account or use OAuth to verify their account.
Users can search for venues in their area, and get an updated list of venues and their upcoming shows.
Users can search for artists, which will display general information about the artist, and more specifically tour information with venue data displayed.
Users can save venues and artists to their profile, allowing them to easily find these venues/artists in a list, and also giving them access to an organized list of tour dates for their favorite artists at their favorite venues.
Data Flow
Describe the flow of data in your application. Write out what happens from the time the user begins using the app to the time the user is done with the app. Think about the “Happy Path” of the application. Describe through visuals and text what requests are made, and what data is processed, in addition to any other details about how the user moves through the site.
Refer to Excalidraw document
Non-Functional Requirements (301 & 401 only)
Non-functional requirements are requirements that are not directly related to the functionality of the application but still important to the app.
Security / OAuth
Usability
Testability
Security / OAuth- is a non-functional requirement assuring all data inside the system or its part will be protected against malware attacks or unauthorized access.
	- Users will be able to sign in with OAuth giving user security.


Usability- is a non functional requirement by not specifying parts of the system functionality, only how that functionality is to be perceived by the user.
Users can easly sign up/log in to view there profile. The sign-up can also be done using 0Auth to verify there identity using Google.
Users can easily navigate the profile page to see what venues and artists they have saved.
Users can also easily search venues by location and see a list of results in their local area.
Users can then save there favorite venues to there profile by clicking a button/favorite icon.
Users can search by artist and add an artist to their profile


Database Schema
Be sure to identify the relationships (if any) between each of your data models:
Does a single item in your database “belong to” just one other item in your database? For example, a person has one passport, and a passport belongs to a single person.
Yes. Every user has stored user authentication data, and this data is only used to authenticate that one user. Also each user can save venues and artists.
Does an item in your database “belong to” multiple other items in your database? For example, a house has many residents, and each resident has one primary house.
No. Not with our current MVP and stretch goals.
Do many items in your database relate to many other items in your database? For example, a band has many musicians, and a musician can be in many bands.
Yes. A user can have many saved artists and venues, and these artists and venues can appear in many other users' saved lists.
Also, include for each separate collection:
The name of each property stored in the collection:
User:
User authentication data
List of saved artists
List elements contain a unique ID for the artist. ID will be used to query the rest of the artist’s information
List of Saved venues
List elements contain a unique ID for the venue. ID will be used to query the rest of the venue’s information.
The required data type:
Whatever the heck OAuth needs for authentication data
Strings for venue and artist IDs
An indication if this collection is associated with another collection.
We only have one data model, so this shouldn’t matter


Blocker
- Found out the API key we were building our site around wasn't available. We used RapidAPI and luckily found a new API that would meet our requirements.
